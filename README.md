# Itraconazole-Sildenafil-DDI

Modeling of published clinical Itraconazole-Sildenafil-DDI studies for model evaluation

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Itraconazole-Sildenafil-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.

The reference model repositories can be found here:
* [Itraconazole OSP PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Itraconazole-Model)
* [Sildenafil OSP PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Sildenafil-Model)
